# To-Do-List

## About
I created this app as part of the Complete Full Stack Development Bootcamp on Udemy, taught by Angela Yu.

This application allows you to create one or more "to-do lists", to which you can add or delete tasks as you please.

## Usage
In the basic state of this application, you are able to make a new list simply by typing a new title in the URL. You are then able to add and delete tasks as text to the list.

## Notes
As of August 18, 2023, this website is currently under development for an expansion.
I am also exploring hosting it on AWS or a similar service.
